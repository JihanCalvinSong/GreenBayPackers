# GreenBayPackers Defense Analysis by Jihan Song

This repository is designed to provide files regarding the 2023-24 Green Bay Packers Defense Analysis focused on Run Defense. 

In the 2023-24 season, the Green Bay Packers struggled with its defense. While the offense made a break-out, the Packers' defense struggled, especially regarding run defense - 2181 yards allowed (28th) and 4.4 yards per carry (T-22nd). This resulted in the firing of the defensive coordinator, Joe Barry, and a huge investment in defense with 2024 draft picks. 

In this project, the Green Bay Packers rushing defense was analyzed with a Python library (nfl_data_py). Here are Key take aways:

- Seal the deal: after brinigng the pressure on QB, the play should lead to more sack, yards lost, or incomplete. 
- Aggressive on first and third down: instead of sitting back line backers to stop short-mid pass game, utilize them to bring faster initial contact and let them help edges to complete their sacks.
- Close the Gap by left guard and right tackle (on Offense view): using 4-3 might help in this case. By having more lineman, the defense can win the leverage easier and close the gap early.
